WAVE 1

There  is  no  tolerance  for  rebels
Lay  down  your  weapons  and  your  family
Will  be  spared


WAVE 2

How  amusing.
Did  you  notice  you  can  collect  points ?
Aim  for  a  high  score !


WAVE 3

That  really  is  weird.
You  can  push  your  allies  around!
Maybe  that  could  help  you  gather  more  points ?


WAVE 4

I've  made  up my  mind.
If  one  of  you  can  get  more  points,  he  will
be  my  right  hand.  You  know  what  you  need  to  do.


WAVE 5

Still  not  done  ?  Hurry  up.
I'm  getting  tired  and  I  can  stop  this 
whenever  I  want.
